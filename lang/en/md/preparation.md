# Preparation of Contracts and Other Legal Documents

After the Republic of Lithuania restored its independence on 11 March 1990, the Lithuanian law was reformed fundamentally. The main accent of the reform in business and civil law areas was passing of the new Civil Code and the Code of Civil Procedure of the Republic of Lithuania. Our lawyers actively contributed to the preparation of these Codes.

Before Lithuania became a full member of the European Union, the Lithuanian law was basically reviewed in accordance with the EU acquis communautaire. Now the Lithuanian legal system being a contemporary law system is based on European law traditions and has features of both the continental and common law systems.
