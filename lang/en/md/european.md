#European Union Law

European Union (EU) law is constantly evolving, from its initial focus on the smooth functioning of the internal market to areas such as foreign and security policy, border control, asylum and visa regimes, policing, the judiciary, etc. In the latter sectors, decisions are generally taken by intergovernmental rather than Community methods.

Successful application of EU law requires not only a thorough knowledge of the general principles of EU law, but also of the entire Community acquis. This includes not only directives, regulations, decisions, opinions, recommendations, resolutions, international treaties concluded by the Communities and other legal acts, but also the case law of the European Court of Justice, quasi-judicial decisions, etc.
