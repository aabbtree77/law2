# Simonas Rėksnys: The Myth that All Lawyers Are Millionaires

[Deimantė Zailskaitė](https://www.respublika.lt/uploads/documents/bj_03_15a.pdf)

Vilnius-based Simonas Rėksnys was a special child because he started reading and writing when he was just two. And at the age of four, he already knew all the world's
capitals of all countries. So it's not surprising that he was offered the chance to jump from first grade to
to fourth grade: he decided that there was nothing for him to do in the lower grades. Now 35 years old
Simon works as a lawyer, speaks at least eight foreign languages and
dials phone numbers from memory.

- Simon, where did you get these
extraordinary abilities?

- A kind of inheritance, I would say.
My uncle is a physicist with a PhD, and he comes from a very educated family, the Chibiris
family. Povilas Čibiras was a professor, a long-standing professor of infectious diseases at Vilnius University.
head of the Department of Infectious Diseases, and also head of the Infectious
chief physician of the Infectious Diseases Hospital and the first
first Lithuanian textbook on infectious diseases
author of the first first manual of infectious diseases. And my mother, when she was pregnant,
ate a lot of fish. And now
reading about the latest scientific research, I have learned that the phosphorus in fish is very good for fetal brain development. It is so
hereditary factors.

- When did you realise that you were different from your peers?

- Perhaps when, at the age of seven
I went to first grade at the age of seven and the school officials suggested I go
straight into fourth grade if I passed
a session of five exams. Back then
there was a five-point system, you had to
to pass at least four
all the exams. And I did it.
I remember I also wrote a dictation, and they tested my knowledge of mathematics and nature. I was immediately transferred
to the fourth grade.

- I guess you were never left for a second year?

- No, I wasn't. (Laughs.)
I graduated with 10s. From
At first, I studied at Vilnius Mykolas
Biržiška Gymnasium, and from the eighth grade - Gabija Gymnasium
in Pašilačiai. I used to be a year
two years younger than my classmates.
Then, at 16, I entered the Law
Faculty of Law at Vilnius University. From
630 applicants, I was the second highest scorer. When I successfully graduated
Faculty of Law, I was faced with the dilemma of what
to choose: scientific or practical
path. I was very good at science, at theoretical subjects, but still
I chose practice. I did practical legal work, not forgetting
theory: in 2003 I published
I published a book on "Labour Law" in 2003. I was editor-in-chief. I was the editor-in-chief of the new edition, because during that time
A lot has changed in the meantime.

- Why did you choose
law and not medicine, as your relative is known for? Were there any lawyers in your family?

- There were and are lawyers. There are two Rėksnys in the family: one is Juozas Rėksnys, a lawyer, and the other is
Julius Rėksnys, Deputy Chief Prosecutor of Vilnius. I didn't choose medicine because I didn't want to
to study for a long time.

- But working as a lawyer
do you like it?

- Of course, I like working as a lawyer
I like it, although it involves a lot of
a lot of money and a lot more
more stress, but I can't imagine myself
in any other profession. Until I was
assistant lawyer from 2007 to
2010, I had to be versatile. Under the current concept
an assistant lawyer must be able to
all branches of law. Both international,
and national law. And then from
2010 I started to specialise
in private international law, which is the branch of law that covers public relations with foreign
element where the parties belong to different states. My clients are foreign firms with interests in Lithuania. And Lithuanian companies,
who have interests abroad.

- In this case, I find it very useful
the fact that you speak a number of foreign languages, even translate. Which languages are easy to
communicate?

- Lithuanian, Russian, English, Polish,
German, Italian, French, Norwegian, Danish... Language learning -
my hobby, combined with work.
For example, during my studies I am
accompanied tourist groups and guided
tours for Italian speakers. Of course, this has helped me a lot in improving my language.
Once I was commissioned to drive from Vilnius to Tallinn for two weeks with a client and a driver, and I was always in the car
to communicate with each other all the time. I get interested in language when
when I have clients in the field -
you have to learn the language. But
you still need to be in the country,
to commit the knowledge to memory.

- Now as a lawyer
as a lawyer, you represent one of Japan's
company. Probably not bad
you have a good command of Japanese as well?

- I am still learning Japanese. There are two
thousand hieroglyphs and you can hurt your eyes learning it. So a lot of Japanese people wear glasses.
(Smiles.) Encrypting those hieroglyphics
may be normal for them, but for us it's
not at all.

- It's common for people to graduate in law but not know what to do next...

- The problem is actually that
there are a lot of lawyers being trained, but not enough, I would say, qualified lawyers. For example, there is a shortage of judges,
the courts are overwhelmed with cases. I had to
to see the queues stretching into the courts. And then there is the myth that all lawyers are millionaires and that they
should be taxed even more because
they already earn a lot. In reality
that's not the case, because the market is very dynamic and very divided: if you are too
expensive, nobody will approach you,
because there will be ten people offering cheaper services.

- But you're probably not getting poorer?

- Of course, I survive, and I also support my parents, who have small pensions. Living with my parents
S.Konarskio Street, I see around me
a lot of poverty. For example, there are bins in our yard, and there is not a day that goes by that someone does not rummage through them.
I almost always see something, and I
I feel very sorry for them.

- Have you considered leaving Lithuania?

- I have no plans to leave Lithuania yet,
All the niches abroad are already taken and,
to achieve something, you would have to start from scratch. And the problem is that
law is more local:
let's say there is Lithuanian law, there is
Polish law, German law, Anglo-Saxon law.
law is fundamentally different...

- I heard that one of your clients is even a sheikh...

- It's not over yet because of the sheikhs. Just because
people are from Pakistan, they
have been denied, discriminatorily
on a discriminatory basis, to give them a visa. A serious businessman was going to engage in legal
business in Lithuania.
He would have created around 20 jobs here.
jobs. This is the situation.

- Is it true that you work without a notebook?

- Yes. But I can say that
memory now is not what it used to be in my twenties. I remember,
there was a Roman law exam.
Three thick volumes of eight hundred pages. And I wrote it all out by heart for the lecturer, as from
textbook - I got a ten and walked out happy.

- Do you have one negative characteristic?

- I have. Maybe too easily
to be influenced by others. And for me it's
cost me a lot - like that false accusation in 2003 in Kaunas
FNTT, at that time very corrupt,
very unprofessional, accused me
of embezzling funds from a company,
we were in litigation for more than three years, from August 2003
12 August 2003 to 26 September 2006.
It was a very difficult and very frustrating process. My mistake -
dealing with the wrong people
people who were greedy and
dishonourable. When things started
came to light, the case at the Kaunas Prosecutor's Office
had already gone to court. There
it began to emerge that completely different people had committed that crime. Then
the Prosecutor General's Office intervened
and put all the dots right,
the right way.

- One can only imagine,
how much nerve it cost you
three years of litigation...

- And no one in Lithuania, unfortunately,
will compensate you. I know one
lawyer who was suing for damages caused to him by investigations -
both moral and direct. And
he was awarded a hundred, two hundred litas, such sums. So, of course, I decided to forget about it, not to go to court at all and
not to raise any anger.

- It seems that your surname does not fit the character type at all?

- That's right, it's not like me
to get angry, to raise my voice, I am more of a calm person. If I were angry,
I would have taken the state to court over that million-dollar investigation
lawsuit. But something has to be done, like Anglo-Saxon law
is famous for million-dollar compensation awards. But here, nobody has that
compensate us, even though the prosecutors
prosecutors have been dragging their feet, investigators have been dragging their feet for years,
and then they say, "Sorry, we're
we dragged you unnecessarily, the investigation
we're closing it down.

- People very often complain about the poor legal situation in Lithuania.
that it should be changed from
fundamentally. What do you think?

- I think that more of the new generation should come to the Lithuanian
legal system, with a new approach. Already some of my peers, for example, are judges.
I think it will work out over time.
