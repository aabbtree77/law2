# Environmental Law

Environment protection is a very important task for the quality of life of the current and future generations. Therefore environmental law is currently one of the most rapidly developing areas of law both in the EU and Lithuania. Lately, a very important process is has been harmonisation of Lithuanian law with EU law and problems of evaluating impact on the environment. The harmonisation process is important not only in transposing EU rules into the national law, but also in implementing them in practice. 

In Lithuania currently all the principles of EU environmental law are complied with: high level of environmental protection, caution and preventive actions, source of damage, “the polluter pays”, integration, sustainable development, etc.
